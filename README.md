apricot is a pure Python package for submodular selection of representative subsets, primarily for the purposes of reducing the size of massive data sets before training machine learning models. Using apricot is extremely simple, as there are two main algorithms implemented. The first is the feature based method, and the second is a facility location function.

### Installation

`pip install apricot`

### Feature Based Selection

The simplest and most scalable form of representative subset selection is that of feature based models.
